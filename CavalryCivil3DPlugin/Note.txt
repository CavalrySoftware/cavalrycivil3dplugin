The Plugin is initially built with .NET Framework to work with Civil3D 2024 and lower versions. 
This can still work in 2025 but cant access the full feature of it.
The DLL references used is from Civil3D 2024 or lower version.

If we need to access 2025 features. We need to recreate a new Project intended for 2025 only.
